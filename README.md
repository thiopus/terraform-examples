# 🌍 Terraform AWS Infrastructure Lab

This is a pet project to practice and showcase Terraform code for provisioning AWS infrastructure. It includes examples of deploying resources like VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more. Code is pushed daily as I build and evolve different parts of the infrastructure.
